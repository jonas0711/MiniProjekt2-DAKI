hi welcome to watch it played my name is Rodney Smith in this video we're going to learn the two to four player game King Domino designed by Bruno khatallah and published by blue orange games what more could a Lord or lady want that to expand their Kingdom and find new lands well I'm not really sure so let's just say that's what they want which is good because in this game you'll be connecting your Domino Kingdom to score the most points so join me at the table and let's learn how to play to set up have each player take one of these starting tiles and one King figure in their chosen color or two King figures each if you're playing a two-player game I'm gonna set up a three player game in this video so we can remove these components now each player finds the castle with their matching color on the top and places it on their starting tile these castles you'll only have to assemble once when you first get the game these are the dominoes which you should shuffle with the number side face up until they are thoroughly mixed now place all of the dominoes back into the box into this area here if you have only two players remove 24 of the dominoes from the box or remove 12 if you have a three player game like we're setting up here if you have four players no dominoes are removed ensure that you've placed the tiles into this area with the numbers facing outward you shouldn't be able to see the images pictured on the dominoes before they're drawn now draw from the box number side up as many Domino's is the number of kings in the game so in this case we would draw three in a two-player game you draw four because remember in that case each player would have two kings for a total of four once you have your Domino's
arrange them in ascending order with the lowest on top down to the highest value then flip them over in that order creating a column from top to bottom again with the lowest value on top and the highest at the bottom now have one of the players collect all of the King pieces shuffling them in their hand and then drawing one randomly from it the player who owns that piece will now put it on one of the unchosen dominoes do this one at a time until all of the kings have been placed we'll see why players might choose certain dominoes but now draw another three tiles from
the box and again sort them in ascending order based on their values and flip them face-up creating another column beside the first one that you created keep in mind when we refer to the top of a column that should always be the exact same Domino for all players no matter how they're seated around the table and that's the setup in King domino players will take turns collecting new dominoes from those reveal then adding them to their personal Kingdom new dominoes will be revealed and taken until eventually the box is empty at that point the game is over and players will score points based on the layout of their own kingdoms the player with the most points will win so let's go back to the table and see exactly how this works the player with their King on the topmost tile the one that had the lowest value on its back collects that tile and then places it in their kingdom which we'll see in more detail in just a moment they then move their King to any unchosen Domino in the next column but before moving on let's learn how you add these collected pieces to your personal Kingdom each tile is made up of two squares and one of the squares must have a full edge against another square within your kingdom when you add it this means that you cannot connect them diagonally you can always connect to your home tile which is the one with the castle sitting on it but when you gain new Domino's later if you want to connect it to something other than your home tile then at least one of the touching squares must have the same pictured landscape so for example I couldn't connect this piece like this but I could connect it like this the orientation of the tile doesn't matter or like this or even like this even though both squares now touching don't match at least one of them does the other restriction is that your kingdom may never grow beyond a perfect 5x5 square area but your castle doesn't have to be in the exact middle for example if I had connected my pieces like this within my kingdom then I could not place this new piece here if we can't we can see we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 squares across at most again we can only have 5 so I might instead place the tile like
as the game goes on you may eventually draw a piece that you are not able to place within your kingdom legally for example if I now gain this Domino my home tile is surrounded so I can't attach to that I'll need to attach to one of these other pieces however here there are no edges that will match to what I have in that case the piece is simply discarded so going back to the main area once the first player has collected their piece added it to their kingdom and then chosen a new tile to stand on top of from the new column the next player in turn order going from top to bottom does the same thing placing their collected piece within their kingdom and then choosing one of the unchosen dominoes in the new column continue like this until all the pieces from the column have been removed and placed in players kingdoms keep in mind in a two-player game each player will go twice because they'll have two kings each either way once all of the Kings are on the new row have a player draw a new column once again ordering the pieces from lowest to highest flipping them over and then placing them face up on the table then you'll repeat the steps that we previously saw having players go in order again from top to bottom so picking the top Domino means you get first pick of the next round so when choosing which Domino to claim you're both considering which one you really want and how high in the turn order you want to be for the next column you'll continue like this collecting pieces adding them to your kingdom creating new rows and collecting again in the new turn order until eventually the last row of dominoes from the box have been placed you'll then play until those are collected by the players and instead of a new row of tiles being added the game is over and it's time to score based on the properties you've created for example here's a Kingdom at the end of the game and it's a perfect 5x5 grid however depending on how you built your Kingdom it's possible things didn't fit together quite so nicely and you might have some gaps or missing spaces now I said before when scoring you'll score the properties within your kingdom properties are the connected groups of squares that share the same art type for example down here we have four squares of connected forest this is one prop
we also have two squares of forest here this is also a property as well and although all of those squares are forest they're counted as two separate properties and will be scored separately you'll find properties of meadows water deserts mines and wastelands to score count the number of squares within a single property multiplying that value by the number of crowns within it so here we have three squares in this meadow property and three crowns within it so three times three is nine this waste lands is three squares and there's two crowns inside of it so two times three is six
keep in mind this also means that if a property has no crowns pictured within it that it will score no points no matter how big it is
for example this forest down here doesn't have any crowns so four times zero is zero
you'll total your separate properties into a single grand total value and the player with the most points in their kingdom wins if there's a tie than the tied player with the most crowns pictured within their kingdom wins and if there's still a tie the tied players share the victory and that's everything you need to know to play King Domino the rule book also contains several variants including one called the mighty duel for two players who will then use all of the dominoes included in the game to create their own 7x7 grids but I'll leave those variants for you to discover on your own if you have any questions about anything that you saw here don't hesitate to put them in the comments below and I'll gladly answer them as soon as I get a chance but until the next episode thanks for watching
